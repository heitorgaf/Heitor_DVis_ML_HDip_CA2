The dataset known as the "E-commerce Customer Behavior and Purchase Dataset" was created with the help of the Faker Python module. By simulating an extensive e-commerce ecosystem, it records several facets of consumer behavior and past purchases in an online marketplace. This dataset is intended for use in e-commerce data analysis and predictive modeling. It works well for projects like trend research, market basket analysis, recommendation systems, and customer churn prediction.
